# Simple Wikipedia Table Extractor

This script extracts tables from Wikipedia pages and saves them as CSV files.

**Why I Use It:**

I'm training to become a Data Analyst, and this script helps me practice:

* **Data Acquisition:** Learning how to get data from online sources.
* **Data Handling:**  Converting web data into a structured format (CSV) for analysis.
* **Automation:**  Automating the process of extracting data instead of manually copying and pasting.

**How to Use It:**

1. **Make sure you have Python installed.**
2. **Install the required libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas

Run the script:

python wiki_table.py

Bash

Enter the Wikipedia URL when prompted.

If multiple tables are found, select the one you want.

The extracted table will be saved as a CSV file in a "databases" folder.
